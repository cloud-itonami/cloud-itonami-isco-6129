  "HusbandryActor — the ISCO-08 6129 animal-producers-not-elsewhere-
  classified farm scheduling/logistics coordination actor as a
  `langgraph.graph/state-graph` (ADR-2607121000 / CLAUDE.md Actors
  section). One graph run = one farm scheduling/logistics operation
  request (intake -> advise -> govern -> decide -> commit/hold, with a
  human-approval interrupt for escalated proposals). No infinite
  internal loop; checkpointed per superstep so an interrupted run can
  resume after human sign-off. Modeled on cloud-itonami-isco-9332's
  cartage.actor.

  ```text
  :intake -> :advise -> :govern -> :decide -+-> :commit            (:ok? true)
                                             +-> :request-approval   (:escalate? true, interrupt-before)
                                             +-> :hold               (:hard? true)
  ```

  The unconditional invariant: the Farm Scheduling Advisor can never
  directly commit a record the HusbandryGovernor refuses — every
  commit-record! call is gated behind `:decide` — and NO commit path
  can ever finalize an animal-treatment/welfare/breeding decision, or
  override a farm safety officer's judgment (permanently out of
  scope, structurally absent from the op allowlist, see
  `husbandry.governor`). Every observation suggesting an animal-
  welfare or injury-risk concern needs attention can ONLY reach a
  human via the always-escalating `:flag-welfare-concern` op — the
  robot's role ends at \"here is the feeding/roster/condition-check-in
  status\", never \"here is whether the animal is fit for breeding\"
  or \"here is the treatment decision\". This actor coordinates farm
  scheduling/logistics ONLY — it never handles the animals and never
  directly makes a treatment/welfare/breeding decision."
